I wanna know how much money you need to live your best life. So I actually have a $5 million net worth at 33 years old. This money will provide me with multiple six figures a year in passive income. And I made a video about how you can figure out your financial independence number or FU number. And I got this comment saying that she wants a million dollars a year to spend in her best life. I literally could not fathom spending that much money a year. I don't even know what I would buy at that point. After the first couple of years of spending a million dollars you know, buying houses, I don't know, are you buying like jets, vacations? Like white cars? Where do you keep putting all of this money? What do you keep buying and spending it on? I gotta know, tell me in the comments.
