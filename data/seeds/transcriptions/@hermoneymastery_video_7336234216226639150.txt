If you think you can't save any money, you're wrong. Let me show you. This is for all the people who think that they don't make enough money to save or they constantly are just not saving money no matter what they do. Today we're going to start the 100 envelope savings challenge. By the end of this challenge, once we've filled up all of the little pockets, we're going to have $5,050. So the binder comes with all these sleeves that have pockets. They're numbered 1 to 100 and those are your envelopes. You see me putting those in the binder here and then it has this sheet where you can color off the amounts. Anytime you have extra cash, you can contribute to the challenge. And how it works is that each slot, the number on it is the amount of dollars you put in that slot. So one, you put $1. Two, you put $2 so on and so forth until the very end. There's no timetable on this. You're not rushed to do this. It's just any time that you have any extra cash, whether you get changed from the gas station, whatever the case is, you come and you put your cash in the slots and then you go to the front page and you color in the amount you just contributed. It's a fun way to hold yourself accountable to saving and also be able to save with as little as $1. When you color in the tracker, it's really fun to see your progress. And once you get to the end, like I said, you'll have over $5,000. I'll be filling up my binder. I'm not sure what my goal is to complete it yet, but if you want to do the challenge with me, I have linked it below. You can save money with any amount of money you make. You just got to get into the habit. You got this friend.
