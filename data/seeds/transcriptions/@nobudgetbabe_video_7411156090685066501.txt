year in their first internship can't fathom working for the rest of their life. Why do you think that is? I got my first corporate job, a corporate job that I worked my ass off to get that I was so excited about and within about a couple of months I started hoping that a car would hit me on my way to work so that I didn't have to go in. I was told that this 9 to 5 was a ticket to wealth and happiness and success but no I wasn't. They lied. I know this is where the boomers are going to jump in and call me entitled for wanting it all when I was just starting out. You know those companies don't have your back either right? There was a woman that I worked with she gave her entire life to this company. She worked 7 to 7 every day. She had no family. She had no kids and after 40 years she had too much vacation time so they just replaced her with somebody younger that they could pay half as much. This is about the time that I found out about my mentor's brother so he started investing young and actually retired and moved to Bali to like live on the beach in his 30s. I'm just like it doesn't have to be like this. Like he escaped the matrix and that is when I changed everything. I started saving and I started investing and I started growing my wealth and I built a $500,000 net worth in my 20s. Now I have become work optional in my 30s and I have helped thousands of other women go down this same path. You don't have to do that bullshit. You don't have to live in unhappiness. You don't have to wait to enjoy your life until you're 65. I am here to teach you. Link in bio to get started.
