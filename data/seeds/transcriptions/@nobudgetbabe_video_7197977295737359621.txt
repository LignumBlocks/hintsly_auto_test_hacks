then i read this review from one of our past students it basically almost brings me to tears and it's a little bit long but i want to share it with you guys because it's just so fucking incredible and it's just such an amazing feeling knowing that so many people are taking the tools that i am teaching them and using it to change their lives for the better and i just i literally can't so and this is from heather and we're actually going to be doing an instagram live with her date tbd which is going to be talking about her experience in the program and all the things and basically she says i have been searching for this program for the last four years not knowing it actually existed okay so this is something she's like i knew that there was something in my life that i needed to change and i knew that i needed to learn these things but i didn't know where to get it from until i found you she says entering the program i had no emergency fund no clue how to invest little to no hope that it actually get to accomplish my big financial goals she was living paycheck to paycheck and feeling defeated in today's economy and i think a lot of you can probably relate to that she goes on to say since completing the program she's making money moves and since i now have an emergency fund that i've actually built up twice because i had emergency last month and for the first time i had cash available my god such a when i says i now have a clear vision and understanding of where my money is and has been going now i'm not living paycheck to paycheck i learned how to negotiate with confidence yes she's on her phone bill her auto insurance is cheaper now her banks reimburse a lot of bank fees as well if you guys don't know you can negotiate like everything i love ashes i now have a robot to paying off my credit card debt which will be paid off within the next two months after fighting all of this extra money so she gave so much confidence that she dropped her fear to change careers okay this is what i say about learning how to win with money and learning how to be confident around your financial decisions can impact so many different areas of your life and we find that so many students come through our programs that come out with better relationships better careers of feeling better about themselves just in general like as a person continues by saying i had zero knowledge prior to this program and i'll have an understanding of how to live as like peace of mind i now have a positive outlook on my future i finally have a realistic plan roadmap to reach my goals because of this program i will be the end to generational poverty is fucking huge and because i can't read anymore because i know i have because i now broken the paycheck to paycheck cycle i have upgraded my life personally but also as a mother this piece of motherhood is now being fulfilled i cannot teach these tools to my kids and know that as they grow they will not have to suffer the way that i did i knew this program would change my life and it did i could cry as i exit i am so grateful and so humble to gain so much knowledge within these three short months my mental and financial situation has been upgraded in such a way and my only choice is to succeed i can't read any more coffee fish all i've ever wanted he says thank you to call i took a look at where i was who i was mentally physically and financially three months ago versus me today and i can't thank you enough thank you for the push to invest myself thank you for being so relatable and pushing me to elevate myself i love this program so much and i just guys like my it looks so gross today but guys this makes me so happy when they see you guys come through the programs when i see you guys im just using our strategies and her tips on social media and you let me know how you're doing and you let me know how this is changing your life these are things that everybody should be taught and we haven't been and this is why i'm so fucking passionate about this because it really does get to be the thing that changes everything for you and i just ah i love it so much
