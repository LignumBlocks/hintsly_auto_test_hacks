You are making good money, but it's flying out of your life. These are my three best tips from someone who went from $40,000 in debt to a millionaire at 30 years old. The best way to get rich is to hack your brain. And to do that you need to understand this one simple concept. You get in life what you believe. Do you believe you always have to work hard to make money? You will. You believe getting rich is only for other people? It will be. This is because when you tell your brain something, it believes it and then it aligns your actions with those beliefs. Everything you have in life right now is the result of the actions you have or have not taken. And that goes right back to what you think. If you want to get rich, you need to rewrite those rules that are not serving you, growing you, or making you happy. And instead change them to ones that build your dream life. Instead of saying, I have to work hard to make money, I want you to say, money gets to be easy. I get paid while I sleep. My bank account never stops growing. That way your brain will start looking for ways to make money with ease.
