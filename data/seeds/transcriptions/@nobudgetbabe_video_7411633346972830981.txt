Something I absolutely cannot stop thinking about is a term called Gen Zero. Listen to how fucking cool this is. Basically, when you are Gen Zero, that means you are the point in your lineage that changed everything for everyone that comes after you. And I am that for my family. Now, I didn't come from money, I didn't marry money, but I did learn everything I could about money. In my 20s, I took myself from $40,000 in debt, living paycheck to paycheck, to becoming a millionaire at 30. And I think it's so easy to forget just how far I've come. It was about maybe like 10 or 12 years ago that I was living in an apartment, it was infested with bed bugs, there were literally shootings outside my window. And now I am living in this gorgeous home on acreage, three car garage. Like y'all, this is my fucking fridge. Do you see how big this is? Like I literally have a pantry. I have a pantry. I finished landscaping last year and we put it, it's hard to see because of the sun, but this gorgeous fire pit, I have a fire pit. Like my bathroom is literally bigger than my childhood bedroom. I am making six figures a year passively. I don't even have to work for money anymore at this point. And now if you are just starting your journey, this is a message to you because I get it, okay? I used to be really fucking angry. I was angry at the government. I was angry at my parents. I was angry at the economy. I was pissed off that so many other people seem to have it so much easier than me. I believe that maybe I could change my situation a little bit, but not a lot. But here I fucking am. $5 million net worth, paid off house, money in the bank, the freedom to travel whenever, wherever I want because I decided that life was going to be different for me. And I promise you, it might not always be easy, but life can be different for you too.
