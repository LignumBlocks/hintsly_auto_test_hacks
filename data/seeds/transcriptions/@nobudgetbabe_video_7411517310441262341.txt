I talk about strategies that you can use to change your financial situation, one of them being a balance transfer card. Basically what this is, is if you have credit card debt and the interest is killing you because you're being charged 20, 24, 29% interest and it is making it difficult to pay down your balance because so much of that money is flying out of your life. A balance transfer card can help fix that. It is a card with a promotional rate maybe for 18 months, 24 months of 0%. And when your interest is 0%, if you keep your payments the same level they were before, you will pay your debt down faster, you will save a ton of money and interest. And what happens when you pay down debt on a credit card? Your credit utilization ratio goes down, this positively impacts your credit score, you stop missing payments, which positively impacts your credit score. And well yes, in the short term there may be a ding on your credit history because you opened up a new card because there was a hard inquiry into your credit. Ultimately becoming debt free faster, saving a ton of money and interest, that is going to be worth any short term negative impact to your credit score. Now there's a big caveat with these and I addressed this in the last video as well. You need to make sure that if you are using something like this, you are moving debt from one place to another, that you are addressing the underlying reasons why you were in debt in the first place. The mindset, the behavior, the not planning for emergencies. Because if you just go and give yourself more available credit, what I see time and time again is people rack that back up and they end up with twice as much debt. Balance transfer cards are a tool in your financial freedom journey, it's not the whole journey.
