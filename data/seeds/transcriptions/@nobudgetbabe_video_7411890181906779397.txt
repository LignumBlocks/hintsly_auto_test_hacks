want to miss this. Today I'm going to be sharing with you guys two ETFs that pay me out thousands of dollars a year in dividends. A dividend is money that just shows up in your account. It's when a company that you own stocks and shares their profits with you. So let's go take a look. So here's a shot from one of my accounts this year. Some of these investments pay me out quarterly and some of them pay out monthly. The first investment is ZRE. This is a real estate investment trust ETF. A REIT is a company that owns and operates real estate and then shares their profits with you. It allows me to get paid like a landlord without actually having to be a landlord. This REIT pays a 5% dividend a year so that's money that just shows up in my bank account and then the value of my shares can also increase. It's made me a part owner in 23 different REITs who own thousands of properties across industries like retail and healthcare and residential. Comparable US REIT would be something like VNQ. The second one in my portfolio is BDY. It's an ETF with a focus on Canadian dividends. This one pays out a 4.7% dividend plus any appreciation that I get as well. Because I'm Canadian I'm focusing on Canadian dividends in my unregistered account so I don't get hit with a US withholding tax. If you're in the US and you're looking for a dividend stock ETF to provide you with passive income, I would take a look at the Dividend Aristocrats or the Dividend Kings. These are companies that have consistently increased how much they pay out over the last 25 to 50 years. Remember if you can learn to drive a car then you can learn to invest.
