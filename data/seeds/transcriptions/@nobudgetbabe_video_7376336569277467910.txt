i totally hear you so let's talk about how you can buy a house without a lot of money the first thing i want to say is buying a house is not a must to becoming financially stable or financially successful you can get rich renting and i have a lot of other videos on this if you want to go back and check or page after but it's true yeah there are benefits to owning that i cannot deny like the emotional our ally of owning your own home or the fact that it is a forced savings plan so what do you do if you want to buy a house but you don't have enough money to buy in the area that you want to live in i gotcha here are four strategies that you can try number one by where you can afford but rent where you want to live this way you can get a foothold on the real estate market you can start building equity but you also get to live in the area that makes you happy amber two you can consider house hacking this would look like buying a home with two or more units or maybe bedrooms that you can actually rent out then living in one and renting out the others depending on the lender you may be able to use the rental income to help you qualify for a mortgage number three you can play the long game you could work on increasing your skill set so that you can get a raise or promotion then using that promotion or raise money to build up your downpayment over the next one to two years then you can use this to buy a starter property that needs some work do the work yourself to lower costs and force appreciation meeting making the house go up in value then sell the home and roll that profits into your dream home this is actually similar to the strategy that i used to help me build a five hundred thousand dollar network in my twenties and the fourth strategy is renting for less than the unrecoverable cost to home ownership and then investing the difference things like taxes maintenance insurance mortgage interest those all add up when you own a home if you can rent for less than those unrecoverable costs then invest the difference you can actually set yourself up to come out further ahead than the homeowner financially because then you'd have a fat investing portfolio that covers your lifestyle expenses including your rent in the time it would have taken you to pay off that thirty year mortgage and you could actually add reads to this portfolio for real estate exposure without ever actually becoming a homeowner or landlord you're not doomed there's always something you can do we just need to find the right strategy that works best for your specific situation and babes i am here to help you build that roadmap to success check out our page for more or look at our lincoln bio to get started with our f free trading
