I blew up that last video so let's talk three more habits that will make you rich from a self-made millionaire And I hope this reaches the right person today because this could be the thing that changes everything for you I wanted this is gonna be controversial, but you need to start setting some small goals now your girl Loves a big goal. I became a self-made millionaire and published author in my 30s But if I woke up every day telling myself Nicole you just need to make a million dollars I would have been overwhelmed as shit instead I set small Realistic laddered goals that build on each other so I can avoid analysis paralysis For example if you want to save a $25,000 down payment on a home Maybe you break it down like this so first we have our down payment 25k. Oh, that's overwhelming, right? So we have our timeline for our goal two years. We're gonna break it down monthly That's going to be a thousand and forty one dollars month, but still feels like a lot instead Let's break that shit down daily that we need to get thirty four dollars and twenty five cents a day thirty five dollars feels a lot More manageable than $25,000 and when things feel easy they become easy number two you got to stop making your own mistakes It has a recovering perfectionist this speaks to me at someone else do the hard shit and then learn from them when I started selling Real estate I became a top broker in less than a year And it's because I had a mentor that taught me exactly what not to do instead of me taking the time energy and money to figure It out myself.
