i myself a millionaire and the biggest myth that i see in the personal finance industry is that you're not allowed to spend any money if you want to win with money i went from forty thousand dollars in debt living paycheck to paycheck while making decent money to becoming a selfie millionaire at the age of thirty while still shopping also eating out while still traveling most of us have been sold the lie that and order to get ahead we need to restrict ourselves we need to give up everything that we love and i'm going to call bullshit because you see spending money is not the enemy spending money out of alignment with our values and our goals as now while i did have to live on less than i made in order to grow my wealth because of you always spend everything you make then you won't have anything to save or invest that doesn't mean that i didn't enjoy my money along the way one of the things i really like splurged on was my house when i originally started looking for a new property i was going to buy one that was probably about half the price but then i started thinking to myself nicole you spend all of your time at home you work at home you are just like a home body why would you spend less money on your house so that you have more money for other places when you don't really want to do other things and that's the thing what may look like a waste of money to one person may not be to another person it all depends on your personal values and your personal goals another thing that i really love to spend money on is travel and vacations i just took the most expensive vacation i've ever been on and it was friggin mind blowing i don't mind paying more for luxury because i want god dress and i want good food and i want good service but here's the thing i will spare and a lot of money on the things that i love but i won't spend a lotta money on things that don't actually bring a lot of value to my life so for example right now i am filming this in my kia could i have a lambo sure but to me it doesn't bring any more value to my life i might feel cool a couple of times driving it but at the end of the day it just becomes the car that i used to drop my kids off at school it's not functional for me me and i would rather save the money that i could spend on a car and spend it on other things that will bring me more joy and personal fulfillment but again this is going to look different for everyone so if you are a car person this doesn't mean that you can't have a nice car but you need to figure out where that lies in your list of priorities the problem becomes when you're spending today gets in the way of future you living the life that you want
